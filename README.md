# Life Expectancy Analysis

## Overview

This project explores the global trends in life expectancy and identifies the key factors that influence life expectancy across different countries. The analysis covers data from 2000 to 2014, examining the role of socio-economic factors, health-related variables, and regional disparities in shaping life expectancy trends. The dataset contains information on countries' life expectancy, health expenditures, immunization rates, GDP, schooling, and more.

## Objective

- **Identify key factors influencing life expectancy**: This includes economic, social, and health-related variables.
- **Analyze trends in life expectancy from 2000 to 2014**: Track how life expectancy has changed over time for various countries.
- **Compare life expectancy across different regions**: Examine how countries from different parts of the world have fared over the years.
- **Examine the relationship between socio-economic factors and life expectancy**: Explore the impact of GDP, education, healthcare expenditure, and immunization on life expectancy.

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains 1,649 rows of data for 1,649 country-year combinations with the following columns:

- **Country**: The country name.
- **Year**: The year of the data entry (from 2000 to 2014).
- **Status**: The status of the country (Developed/Developing).
- **Life Expectancy**: The average life expectancy at birth for each country.
- **Adult Mortality**: The number of adult deaths per 1,000 people.
- **Infant Deaths**: The number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births.
- **Alcohol**: Per capita alcohol consumption in liters.
- **Percentage Expenditure**: Government expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP.
- **Hepatitis B**: The percentage of the population immunized against Hepatitis B.
- **Measles**: The number of measles cases per 1,000 children.
- **BMI**: Average body mass index (BMI) of the population.
- **Under-Five Deaths**: The number of deaths per 1,000 children under five years old.
- **Polio**: The percentage of the population immunized against polio.
- **Total Expenditure**: Total health expenditure per capita (USD).
- **Diphtheria**: The percentage of the population immunized against diphtheria.
- **HIV/AIDS**: The number of people living with HIV/AIDS per 1,000 people.
- **GDP**: Gross Domestic Product per capita (USD).
- **Population**: The total population of the country.
- **Thinness 1-19 Years**: The percentage of people aged 1-19 years who are underweight.
- **Thinness 5-9 Years**: The percentage of children aged 5-9 years who are underweight.
- **Income Composition of Resources**: A composite index of income distribution and economic resources.
- **Schooling**: Average number of years of schooling for adults aged 25 and older.

## Key Findings

- **Life Expectancy Trends (2000-2014)**: Life expectancy increased globally, with regions such as Europe and North America showing the highest levels. Sub-Saharan Africa showed improvements but remained lower compared to other regions.
- **Economic & Social Determinants**: Higher GDP, income composition, and years of schooling were strongly associated with longer life expectancy.
- **Immunization & Health Indicators**: While immunization rates (Hepatitis B, Polio, Diphtheria) played a role, their impact on life expectancy was less pronounced compared to other factors like education and income.
- **Regional Disparities**: South America showed an unexpected decline in life expectancy, suggesting the need for targeted public health interventions despite economic growth.

## Analysis and Visualizations

- **Trends over Time**: Line charts and bar graphs showing life expectancy changes from 2000 to 2014.
- **Correlations**: Scatter plots illustrating the relationship between life expectancy and variables like GDP, schooling, immunization rates, etc.
- **Regional Comparison**: Regional heat maps or bar charts to compare life expectancy across different continents and income statuses.

## Conclusions

    Education and income composition are the most significant factors affecting life expectancy.
    Public health interventions in South America are necessary to tackle the decline in life expectancy, particularly around diseases like HIV/AIDS.
    This analysis demonstrates the need for improved public health strategies to address regional disparities and health crises in developing nations.
