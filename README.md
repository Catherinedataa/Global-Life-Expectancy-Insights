# **Life Expectancy Analysis**

## **Overview**  
This project explores global trends in life expectancy and identifies key factors influencing it across different countries. The analysis covers data from **2000 to 2014**, examining the role of **socio-economic factors, health-related variables, and regional disparities** in shaping life expectancy trends.  

The dataset contains information on **countries' life expectancy, health expenditures, immunization rates, GDP, schooling, and more**.

## **Objective**  
- **Identify key factors influencing life expectancy** – including economic, social, and health-related variables.  
- **Analyze trends in life expectancy (2000–2014)** – tracking changes across different regions.  
- **Compare life expectancy across different regions** – examining disparities in global health.  
- **Examine the relationship between socio-economic factors and life expectancy** – exploring the impact of **GDP, education, healthcare expenditure, and immunization**.

 **Population** – Total population of the country.  
 **Thinness (1-19 Years)** – % of underweight individuals aged 1–19 years.  
 **Thinness (5-9 Years)** – % of underweight children aged 5–9 years.  
 **Income Composition of Resources** – Economic resource index.  
 **Schooling** – Average years of schooling (ages 25+).  



## **Key Findings**  

### ** Global Life Expectancy Trends (2000–2014)**  
✅ **Overall Increase** – The **global average life expectancy** rose from **67.3 years (2000) to 71.5 years (2014), a 4.2-year increase**.  
✅ **Regional Differences**:  
   - **Europe & North America**: Highest, averaging **79.6 years** in 2014.  
   - **Sub-Saharan Africa**: Lowest, but improving, from **52.8 years (2000) to 59.3 years (2014)**.  
   - **South America**: Declined in **some countries despite GDP growth**, signaling possible healthcare inefficiencies.

### ** Socio-Economic & Health Determinants**  
✅ **Correlation Between GDP & Life Expectancy**: A **strong positive correlation (r = 0.78)** suggests that **higher GDP per capita is strongly linked to longer life expectancy**.  
✅ **Education Matters**:  
   - Countries with **higher schooling years (above 12 years)** had an **average life expectancy of 76.2 years**.  
   - Countries with **less than 6 years of schooling** averaged **62.5 years**.  
✅ **Healthcare Spending**:  
   - Countries spending **above 8% of GDP on health** had an **average life expectancy of 75.4 years**.  
   - Countries spending **below 5%** averaged **65.8 years**.  

---

### ** Healthcare & Immunization**  
✅ **HIV/AIDS Impact**:  
   - A **10% increase in HIV/AIDS prevalence correlated with a 4.8-year reduction** in life expectancy.  
✅ **Immunization & Child Survival**:  
   - **Diphtheria Immunization (above 90%)**: Linked to a **30% lower under-five mortality rate**.  
   - **Polio Immunization (above 85%)**: No significant direct impact on overall life expectancy but **strongly correlated with lower infant deaths**.  

---

### ** Regional Disparities**  
✅ **Developed vs. Developing Countries**:  
   - **Developed nations (Europe, North America)**: Life expectancy **averaged 78+ years**, regardless of fluctuations in health spending.  
   - **Developing nations (Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia)**: Life expectancy was **highly sensitive to income fluctuations**, with a **1% GDP increase leading to a 0.42-year increase** in life expectancy.  

---

## **Conclusion**  

✔ **Economic growth is a strong predictor of higher life expectancy (r = 0.78), but education has an even stronger impact.**  
✔ **Healthcare spending improves child survival, but without economic and educational progress, its effect on overall life expectancy is limited.**  
✔ **Regions with high HIV/AIDS prevalence (above 5%) had a significantly lower life expectancy (by 4.8 years on average).**  
✔ **South America’s unexpected decline highlights the need for deeper investigation into healthcare system effectiveness, despite economic progress.**

### **Final Thought**  
This analysis highlights the **critical role of education, income, and healthcare access in improving global life expectancy**. Addressing **regional disparities and healthcare inefficiencies** will be essential for future improvements in public health outcomes.
